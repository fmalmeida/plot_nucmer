 # Bye Bye
 Now your plot is complete and must be available at: ${RESULTS}/conf/

 All the required files for a minimal circos plot have been produced and stored at ${RESULTS}/conf/.
 Now you can play with the ${RESULTS}/conf/circos.conf file in order to change the plot as you like.

 Remember to read the circos manual in order to understand the conf file.

 Have fun!
